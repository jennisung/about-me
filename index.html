        <p id="bio-paragraph"> Welcome to my page! Let me give a brief introduction about myself. My name is Jennifer Sung, a proud New Yorker and a Brooklyn native. Following my high school graduation, I enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a healthcare specialist for four years. During these four years, I worked as a medic at a clinic on base in Fort Carson, located in Colorado. I tended to patients each day, providing exceptional patient care. I also got the opportunity to go to Kuwait, where I taught basic first aid to Kuwaiti soldiers. After getting out, I pursued a degree in Political Science at Columbia University, where I also worked as a teaching assistant for math classes and assisted the IT department. With my studies now completed, I've decided to transition into the tech industry and enrolled in Code Fellows to pursue this new career path. </p>
